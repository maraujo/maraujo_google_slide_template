# MARAUJO Google Slide Template
Here you find the script for my (a simple but nice) Google Slide Template using script editor.
This is an extension from what you can create using this Google's tutorial on how to create a progress bar that you can find in this link: https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/editors/slides/quickstart/progress-bar

# Installation

# Customization
To customize the colors and text (presenter name, title) you just need to change the gloval variables in the begin of this template.
